Due to calls and pressure from constituents, as of end of the day Tuesday, 44 senators both oppose confirmation and oppose invoking \"cloture\" (the procedure for ending a debate and taking a vote). As the Senate rules currently stand, without 60 votes to invoke cloture, the vote to confirm Gorsuch could be delayed indefinitely.\n\nIt is expected that as these 44 senators take part in a filibuster, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell will enter a point of order and ask for a Senate rule change to allow cloture to be invoked for Supreme Court confirmations with a simple majority. This would then end the filibuster and move the nomination forward to an up and down vote, all but assuring that Neil Gorsuch is confirmed.",

While the House Freedom Caucus's stubbornness helped kill Trumpcare, their extremist input would make the updated bill even worse than the widely-disliked original. The Freedom Caucus has proposed letting states opt out of two popular ACA policies: the requirement that all insurance plans cover essential health benefits, and the community rating provision, which requires insurers to charge everyone who is the same age the same price. These two changes would functionally remove protections for people with preexisting conditions by allowing insurers to charge sicker people astronomically higher premium rates. The provision would also significantly reduce the coverage offered in many insurance plans by allowing insurers to offer skimpy plans that omit coverage for things like hospital care, prescription drugs, and maternity care. According to a recent report by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, 75% of Americans prefer Congress work to improve the ACA instead of pursuing a replacement.

Further, Gorsuch's record shows a strong tendency to fight for businesses over individuals. His appelate court record shows him siding with insurance companies seeking to deny disability benefits, with employers wanting to cut pension benefits, and with employers defending against payment of employment discrimination claims.  \n\nMost telling are the cases where he dissented from even his conservative colleagues on the Tenth Circuit. Some examples:\n* In TransAm Trucking, Inc. v. Administrative Rev. Bd., Gorsuch dissented in favor of a trucking company when they fired an employee for refusing to drive his truck with frozen brakes in subzero temperatures.\n* In Compass Environmental, Inc. v. Occupational Safety \u0026 Health Review Commission, Gorsuch dissented from a decision against a company that failed to properly train a worker, resulting in his death by electrocution.\n* In Salmon v. Astrue, Gorsuch dissented against the majority ruling that a hearing examiner had disregarded evidence supporting a claim for disability benefits. \n* In WWC Holding Co. v. Sopkin, Gorsuch argued that a wireless service carrier should be able to avoid the Colorado Public Utilities Commission’s efforts to enact state-specific consumer protection standards for wireless phone service. \n\nMeasured against his own colleagues on the Tenth Circuit, including Republican appointees, Gorsuch is consistently beholden to corporate interests, and should not be elevated to the Supreme Court.",

LIHEAP is a critical safety net program that provides emergency cash assistance to low-income families to help keep the heating or cooling on during the winter, the summer, and extreme weather conditions. If LIHEAP is eliminated, 6.1 million low-income households would lose access to financial assistance for heat and utilities. According to the most recent survey by the National Energy Assistance Director's Association, 89% of LIHEAP beneficiaries are households that include a senior, child, or a disabled person, and 20% of beneficiaries are veterans and their families. On average, families receive $458 in cash assistance for utilities from this program.\n\nFunding for LIHEAP is already insufficient. The money regularly runs out mid-winter, leaving millions of families to choose between living in freezing conditions and putting food on the table. While it is illegal for a utility company to completely shut off the heat during winter in many states, without LIHEAP, millions of families would be forced to ration meager heat, and would live in conditions that would devastate both short and long term health. \nLIHEAP is one of the programs that most directly benefit low-income Americans, and is a lifeline for millions of seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income working families. Eliminating this program and destroying an essential piece of our social safety net would be an assault on the health of the most vulnerable in our country.",

More recently, Trump recommended cutting the NIH's budget by $1.2 billion for the remainder of this fiscal year, which would cut science programs as well as threaten funding to the Teen Pregnancy Prevention Program, the National Science Foundation, and the Environmental Protection Agency. The NIH has an annual budget of about $32.3 billion and is tasked with finding cures for diseases and advancing technology. 10% of the NIH's funding is spent on administrative costs, 10% on its own research, and the remaining 80% is distributed in the form of competitive grants to over 300,000 scientists and researchers at more than 2500 universities, medical schools, and other institutions in every state and around the world. These grants also support 400,000 jobs. As a result of these contributions, Congress voted with bipartisan support this past December to pass the 21st Century Cures Act, which gave the NIH an additional $4.8 billion over the next five years. Trump's budget proposal thus ignores not only NIH's many contributions to society but also Congress's bipartisan support for the organization's work.",

This adds confidence to the mounting evidence that has come to light in recent months, including communications between the Russians and Jeff Sessions, Mike Flynn, Paul Manafort, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Jared Kushner.\n\nSince then, however, Committee Chair Devin Nunes has shown blatant partisanship and inappropriate favoritism towards the White House. He held a press conference to discuss Trump's wire-tapping claims and other vague details pertaining to the Russia investigation, supposedly to help Trump with the bad media attention he had been receiving. He briefed the White House on new investigation information before sharing it with Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee. It also appears that the day before his bizarre press conference, Nunes went to the White House where 2 staff members provided him with intelligence reports.These actions not only go against investigative protocol, but they also reek of political loyalty to the Trump administration, for which Nunes served as a transition official. This investigation can no longer remain dependent upon partisan congressional committees. An independent 9/11-style special commission into Russia's interference must be established. \n\nTo do this, 198 House Democrats and one House Republican have co-sponsored H.R.356, the Protecting Our Democracy Act. The bill would institute an independent commission of 12 nongovernmental appointees to fully investigate Russian interference in the 2016 elections. A similar bill in the Senate, S.27, has 24 co-sponsors.",

         "reason":"When President Trump’s budget plan came out last week, many Americans were dismayed to see drastic cuts to the programs that support our communities and grow our economy. One of these programs, the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP), may have its funding cut by $124 million.\n\nThe MEP is a public-private partnership funded by the states, private businesses, and federal funds. Businesses work with their local MEP office to learn techniques to become more competitive in the marketplace, from streamlining their supply chain to improving their sustainability footprint. In just the last 3 years, over 1,000 small and medium size manufacturers from across the country have benefited from MEPs. According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, for every $1 of federal investment, the MEP national network generates $17.90 in new sales growth for manufacturers, and for every $1,501 of federal investment, MEP creates or retains one manufacturing job. This means that Trump's $124 million cut will cost the economy $2.2 billion in revenue and 82,000 jobs. For someone who promised economic growth and the return of manufacturing jobs, cutting the MEP program is the wrong way to accomplish that.",

         "name":"Defend Federal Funding for Sanctuary Cities",
         "reason":"In keeping with an earlier executive order from President Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions has threatened to withhold Justice Department grant funding from jurisdictions that refuse to disclose people's immigration status to the federal government. This policy targets the nation's approximately 60 \"sanctuary cities,\" which include New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Seattle, and Boston, that have refused to cooperate with federal ICE deportations of noncriminal undocumented immigrants. Sessions' rule is at odds with the Constitution's Tenth Amendment and decades of case law that argue that the federal government cannot broadly withhold federal funding from local jurisdictions to force compliance with federal mandates. Even Trump advisor Rudy Giuliani recognized the constitutional limits to federal interference in local compliance with immigration. In 1996, he stated, \"The Tenth Amendment provides that 'The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.' One right not granted to the federal government is the right of state and local governments to provide for the health and safety of their local communities.\" \n\nSessions hopes to bypass the Constitution by withholding funding only for local and state law enforcement. The decision to cut funding to local law enforcement in the name of improving public safety defies logic and deprives local law enforcement of money used to fight and prevent crimes that actually threaten Americans. While Sessions cites safety concerns to justify defunding sanctuary cities, a study of 2,492 US counties by the Center for American Progress and the National Immigration Law Center found that sanctuary counties are significantly safer and more economically prosperous than non-sanctuary jurisdictions. Multiple studies (including those by the University of Massachusetts, Northwestern, and the University of California) have also shown that first generation immigrants, regardless of their legal status, are less likely than native-born Americans to commit crimes. Threats to sanctuary cities also undermine local government and law enforcement's mission to build trust and protect the communities they serve. Despite claiming to dislike big government, the Trump administration and Jeff Sessions are interfering with state and local policy, violating the Constitution and undermining local governments' ability to protect their people.",
